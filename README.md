## Hi, I'm Carlton

I'm a software engineer. I've been doing that since I was 12.

### For Work, I specialize in backend cloud systems, and the JVM (Java, Kotlin, Clojure). 

I'm a systems-view person, meaning I view the System as a collection of parts, and I like to know all the parts: application architecture, deployment infrastructure, network, performance, telemetry, etc. I generally prefer the command line to IDEs in cases where the IDE buys me little. I do a lot of automation using bash, Python, and Perl. I'm adept at all things Cloud, Automation, and Infrastructure as Code.

**I'm an API and Data Jockey**. 

I've authored and taught a course on [REST APIs in Springboot](https://spring.academy/courses/building-a-rest-api-with-spring-boot). 

I'm adept at various dialects of SQL, as well as noSQL DBs like Dynamo and Redis. 

I work with streaming data, like Kafka, and appreciate using queues to introduce stability into a system. I love Rich Hickey's quote: *If you aren't using queues, use them. And if you are, use them more!* He's referring not to external queue products liek Rabbit or Kafka, but rather Clojure's built-in queue mechanism. And, I could moention Go's channels in the same breath. And Reactive programming provides similar results in terms of using backpressure as a system regulator. 

Finally, my **outlook on how to design data models** is inspired by DDD; the Law of Demeter; and in general the principle of loose coupling and interface independence and segregation (one of the SOLID principles). I sincerely believe that **simplicity and decoupling** are two of the most important ingredients in quality software. And if your AI doesn't know that, maybe you should be in charge of writing code - NOT AI.

**I'm fascinated by all things Data**. I'm particularly fascinated by Modern Search, NLP, ML (the classic algortihms), and AI (particularly as it relates to Actual Understanding, as opposed to slapping some vaocab into an LLM).

### For Fun, I collect.

I have a collection of Lists (of lists ...) So basically, **I Collect Data**. Really. That's what [Moocho Me](https://github.com/cschuyle/moocho-me) and [Datagator](https://github.com/cschuyle/datagator) are all about.

I like Languages (the human kind as well as the computer kind). I collect translations of a few books, foremost among them [Le Petit Prince](https://lepetitprince.international).

I have a very unwieldy collection of glassware, consisting of **beer glasses** from the dawn of my travels.

Also unwieldy is my collection of **books** (the kind made out of paper).
