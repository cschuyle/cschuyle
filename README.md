## Hi, I'm Carlton

I'm a software engineer. I've been doing that since I was 12. But most people are interested in the story starting today and working backwards ... So more or less:
```
Java
Spring
Kotlin
Go
Typescript
React
Python
Ruby
Clojure
Perl
VB
C++
C
SQL
LISP
Prolog
6502 ASM
Applesoft BASIC
```

### For Work, I specialize in backend cloud systems, and the JVM (Java, Kotlin, Clojure). 

I'm a systems-level person, meaning I use the command line, do a lot of automation using bash and python, and am adept at all things Cloud, Automation, Infrastructure as Code.

**I'm an API and Data Jockey**. I used to teach a course on REST APIs in Springboot. I'm adept at various dialects of SQL, as well as noSQL dDBs like Dynamo and Redis. I'm also a streaming data guru (Kafka). I also have a DDD-inspired outlook on how to look at data models in terms of design and implementation.

**I'm fascinated by all things Data**. I'm particularly fascinated by Modern Search, NLP, ML (the classic algortihms), and AI (particularly as it relates to Actual Understanding, as opposed to slapping some vaocab into an LLM).

### For Fun, I collect.

I have a collection of Lists (of lists ...) So basically, **I Collect Data**. Really. That's what [Moocho Me](https://github.com/cschuyle/moocho-me) and [Datagator](https://github.com/cschuyle/datagator) are all about.

I like Languages (the human kind as well as the computer kind). I collect translations of a few books, foremost among them [Le Petit Prince](https://lepetitprince.international).

I also have a very unwieldy collection of glassware. This consists mostly beer glasses from my travels.
